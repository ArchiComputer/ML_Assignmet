            The most recent United Nations report, dated 2018, indicates that more than half of the global populace resided in urban
            areas, a number projected to climb to 68% by 2050. As urbanization accelerates, cities face new challenges necessitating
            innovative solutions in housing, infrastructure, services, and transportation. Meeting evolving mobility demands
            requires affordable, environmentally friendly, and dependable transport methods to enable smooth movement of people and
            goods, thus tackling issues like traffic congestion, air pollution, and lengthy commutes.         </p><br>
          <p class="home__description">
            Seoul Bicycle Sharing is a public bike-sharing initiative available in Seoul, South Korea, engineered to offer
            convenient and eco-friendly transportation options for residents and visitors alike. The performance of Seoul Bicycle
            Sharing has been consistently improving year by year. The average daily use surged to 87,817, marking a six-fold
            increase from 2017 (13,783 cases). The rental cases from January to May 2022 totaled 14.14 million, indicating a 38.3%
            increase compared to the same period last year.
          </p><br>
          <p class="home__description">
            This study centers on the emerging phenomenon of shared bicycles as a means to boost daily bicycle traffic. Shared
            bicycles allow users to access bicycles provided by local governments or platform companies via smart devices whenever
            needed, even if they don't typically own a bicycle. This system helps overcome some of the challenges posed by
            geographical constraints of traditional bicycles, as they can be easily returned when traveling long distances or facing
            slopes, and can seamlessly integrate with other modes of transportation such as subways and buses. Shared bicycles are
            expected to see increased use in daily commuting and other travel needs, especially among the younger generation
            accustomed to new shared culture and technology, expanding beyond the traditional leisure-oriented use of bicycles.
          </p><br>
          <p class="home__description">
            The primary dataset used in this study is derived from the usage status of public bicycles (Ttareungi) provided by the
            Seoul Open Data Square. This dataset includes information on rental station locations, as well as monthly, daily, and
            hourly usage statistics. Variables such as rental date, rental time, rental station name, user age group, and duration
            of usage are incorporated for analysis. This dataset is particularly valuable as it provides spatial origin information,
            enabling examination of demographic characteristics within different regions. Additionally, the dataset integrates
            moving distance and usage duration under similar conditions, although it is important to note that individual data
            points must be averaged to derive meaningful insights regarding moving distance and usage duration.          </p><br>

            Despite its growing popularity, concerns over the mounting deficit have surfaced. The deficit, which stood at 9 billion
            won in 2019, increased to 9.9 billion won in 2020 and 10.3 billion won last year. The annual deficit of Seoul Bicycle
            Sharing has been steadily rising since 2016, reaching 2.5 billion won. Behind the project's acclaim, such as the Seoul
            Metropolitan Government's announcement to inject 3,000 more bicycles this year, the chronic deficit remains unresolved.

            Machine learning technology can play a pivotal role in optimizing operations, enhancing user experience, and ensuring
            the long-term sustainability of Seoul Bicycle Sharing and similar bike-sharing programs. Firstly, by analyzing
            historical usage data, machine learning algorithms can forecast bicycle demand at different times and locations across
            the city, facilitating optimal bike distribution to meet demand. Secondly, machine learning algorithms can adjust
            pricing dynamically based on factors like time of day, weather conditions, and special events, encouraging usage during
            off-peak hours and less congested areas. This strategy helps balance demand across the system. Lastly, machine learning
            algorithms can analyze sensor data from bicycles to predict potential mechanical failures or maintenance needs
            preemptively, minimizing downtime and enhancing overall user satisfaction.

            Answers to the following 12 questions will be obtained through dataset analysis and based on the results, it will help
            create a more economical and sustainable Seoul shared bicycle business.<br>

          The 'Seoul Bicycle Sharing' dataset was initially intended to be sourced from https://data.seoul.go.kr/. However, due to
          the Lunar New Year holiday season in East Asia, the servers hosting the bike dataset were temporarily suspended.
          Consequently, an alternative dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/seoul-bike-sharing/data was
          utilized. This dataset includes various fields such as 'date', 'temperature_2m', 'relative_humidity_2m', 'dew_point_2m',

            Clustering is a machine learning technique that organizes unlabeled data into meaningful groups based on similarity.
            Distance metrics, such as Euclidean, Manhattan, and Cosine, quantify this similarity. There are two main types of
            clustering: partitional and hierarchical.
            In partitional clustering, data is divided into non-overlapping clusters, with each point assigned to a single cluster.
            Popular algorithms include K-means and K-medoids. On the other hand, hierarchical clustering builds a nested tree
            structure to represent data relationships, with agglomerative and divisive methods used to merge or split clusters.
            Partitional clustering is better for predefined cluster counts and scalability, while hierarchical clustering is
            preferred for exploring relationships and insights.
            This study employs k-means clustering with Euclidean distance as the primary distance metric. Euclidean distance, the
            default choice in k-means clustering, measures the straight-line distance between two points in multidimensional space.
            Its formula considers the squared differences of coordinates between points, offering an intuitive, computationally
            efficient, and effective measure for clustering various datasets.

            This study focuses on the process of Identifying Station Profiles within a bike share system. It entails categorizing

            according to the volume of bikes picked up and dropped off across different times of the week, specific usage trends
            emerge, such as heightened activity at commuter stations during rush hours, increased usage at leisure-focused stations
            on weekends, and fluctuations related to special events. Furthermore, grouping stations based on their frequency of
            being either empty or full reveals areas requiring frequent bike redistribution, offering insights into potential
            improvements in system logistics.<br>
            The Discovery Process outlined in this study comprises essential steps for analyzing bike share system dynamics.
            Initially, it involves preparing the data by cleaning and formatting station-level and trip data and potentially
            deriving additional features like bike turnover rates or trip frequencies between stations. Subsequently, selecting
            relevant features such as pickup/drop-off times and station occupancy levels helps in refining the analysis.
            Experimentation with various clustering algorithms enables the exploration of station patterns, followed by assessing

            In this study, the plan is to utilize the normalized data and execute k-means clustering using Python code. The process
            of K-means with Euclidean Distance entails several key steps. Initially, the number of clusters, denoted as 'k', needs
            to be determined, a pivotal decision often requiring domain expertise or iterative experimentation. Subsequently, the
            algorithm randomly selects 'k' data points from the dataset as the initial centroids for the clusters. Following this,
            for each remaining data point, the algorithm computes the Euclidean distance to each centroid and assigns the point to
            the cluster with the closest centroid. Upon completing assignments, the algorithm updates centroids by computing the
            mean of all data points within each cluster, adjusting centroid positions accordingly. This iterative process continues,
            potentially leading to changes in cluster membership as centroids shift, until convergence is achieved. Convergence is
            indicated when centroids no longer substantially move or a predetermined maximum number of iterations is reached,
            signifying stability in the clustering. The Euclidean Distance, utilized as the distance measure, represents the
            "straight-line" distance between two points in space and is favored for its intuitive nature, computational efficiency,
            and compatibility with the spherical cluster assumption inherent in K-means clustering.
            Also, In this study, the objective is to utilize the normalized data and conduct hierarchical clustering using the
            Cosine Similarity method through R code. The process of hierarchical clustering entails iteratively identifying the most
            similar pairs of clusters based on cosine similarity and merging them into new clusters. This iterative procedure
            results in the construction of a hierarchical cluster structure, visualized as a dendrogram. The utilization of Cosine
            Similarity with hclust is advantageous in scenarios where the relative proportions or patterns of features hold more
            significance than their absolute magnitudes. Additionally, if vectors are already normalized (with a magnitude of 1),
            cosine similarity simplifies to cosine distance (1 - cosine similarity), making it directly applicable for clustering
            purposes. This metric is particularly effective when the objective is to cluster data points based on the similarity of
            their overall shapes rather than their magnitudes.

            The silhouette method assesses the quality of clustering solutions by examining silhouette scores, with higher scores
            indicating better clustering. When plotting silhouette scores against the number of clusters (k), the optimal number of
            clusters, or the "best k," is typically identified as the value of k corresponding to the highest average silhouette
            score. This value signifies the number of clusters that maximizes the cohesion within clusters while maximizing the
            separation between them, providing the most meaningful and distinct grouping of data points.
            Based on the silhouette scores obtained from your code, the silhouette method suggests that the optimal number of
            clusters, or the "best k" value, is 5. This is evident as the silhouette score corresponding to k=5 (0.768) is the

            between clusters; longer branches imply greater dissimilarity. Identifying significant changes, resembling an elbow in a
            chart, where vertical line lengths sharply increase, indicates natural points for "cutting" the tree to obtain distinct
            clusters. This elbow-like pattern assists in estimating the optimal number of clusters, achieving a balance between
            meaningful distinction and manageable complexity, although it's not infallible. Therefore, the dendrogram suggests that
            the best value of k is 5.

            stops can be effectively categorized by these five criteria. These criteria are as follows: Cluster 1 represents

            Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are fundamental mathematical concepts that play a crucial role in Principal Component
            Analysis (PCA), a technique used for dimensionality reduction. Eigenvectors represent new directions or axes in a

            Dimensionality reduction is the process of transforming high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation
            while retaining important information. It simplifies analysis and visualization by summarizing datasets with many
            features into fewer dimensions, preserving essential patterns. This process is crucial for overcoming the curse of
            dimensionality, where high-dimensional spaces become sparse and challenging for machine learning models to interpret
            effectively. By reducing dimensions, computational efficiency is improved, making data processing faster and more
            manageable, particularly for large datasets. Moreover, lower-dimensional data enables improved visualization, allowing
            for the identification of clusters, trends, and outliers. Additionally, dimensionality reduction helps to eliminate
            noise and redundancies within the data, leading to cleaner datasets. An example illustrates how a dataset with numerous
            customer features can be compressed into a smaller set of informative features, enhancing both computational efficiency
            and visualization capabilities.

            High-dimensional data, characterized by a plethora of features or variables, poses numerous challenges that necessitate
            the use of dimensionality reduction techniques for mitigation. These challenges include the curse of dimensionality,
            where sparsity, distorted distances, and overfitting hinder pattern recognition and model generalization. Additionally,
            computational complexity escalates significantly with high-dimensional data, impeding efficient algorithmic processing.
            Noise and redundancy further obscure data patterns, while the inability to directly visualize data beyond three
            dimensions limits insights. Dimensionality reduction addresses these challenges by streamlining feature sets, making
            distances more interpretable, and enhancing algorithmic performance through noise reduction. It also accelerates
            computations, facilitates visualization in lower dimensions, and compresses data for storage efficiency.

            PCA aims to capture variance effectively, making it less suitable for discrete variables unless appropriately encoded
            numerically. Additionally, PCA is sensitive to feature scale discrepancies, requiring data standardization or
            normalization to ensure equal feature contributions. Furthermore, PCA assumes linear relationships between features,
            potentially limiting its effectiveness if strong non-linear relationships exist. In conclusion, for optimal PCA
            outcomes, data should be numeric, predominantly continuous, scaled, and exhibit linear relationships among features. The

            range of -1 to 1. These clusters are notably dominant, forming tightly clustered groups within the plot. In contrast,

            stops attract considerable user activity, suggesting that they are busy locations. Therefore, it's essential to delve

            Scatter plots of data points along PC1 and PC2 are effective tools for identifying patterns, clusters, or trends within

            A biplot combines two essential components of PCA analysis into a single graphical representation. The score plot
            illustrates the locations of individual data samples projected onto the new principal components, typically PC1 and PC2,
            akin to a standard scatter plot with the axes representing the newly calculated PCs. Concurrently, the loading plot
            represents original variables as vectors, indicating both the direction and strength of each variable's contribution to
            the principal components. Through biplots, relationships within the data are unveiled: data points reveal similarities
            or differences along the reduced dimensions of the principal components, potentially indicating clusters or patterns
            within the data. Additionally, variables represented by loading vectors illustrate their relationships with the
            principal components: similar directions denote positive correlations, while opposite directions indicate negative
            correlations. The length of the vectors signifies the strength of the variables' influence on the principal components,
            while the angle with an axis indicates the degree of correlation. By projecting data points perpendicularly onto
            variable vectors, biplots assist in identifying variables that characterize specific clusters or regions within the
            plot.
            PC1 and PC2 exhibit an angle of nearly 90 degrees, indicating a lack of significant correlation. The length of each
            vector illustrates the strength of a variable's influence on a principal component, with longer vectors representing
            stronger associations. Notably, PC2 demonstrates a stronger association than PC1.

            Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are fundamental mathematical concepts that play a crucial role in Principal Component
            Analysis (PCA), a technique used for dimensionality reduction. Eigenvectors represent new directions or axes in a
            high-dimensional dataset, with each eigenvector capturing the direction of greatest variance in the data.
            Eigenvalues,
            corresponding to each eigenvector, quantify the amount of variance along that direction, with larger eigenvalues
            indicating more significant variability. In PCA, the goal is to find eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalues, as
            these
            represent the most informative directions in the data. By projecting the data onto these principal components, PCA
            retains essential data characteristics while reducing dimensionality. An analogy likens eigenvectors to lines that
            best
            fit through the elongated parts of a cloud of data points, with eigenvalues indicating the extent of elongation.
            In

        <h2 class="title">Conclusion</h2>
      <section id="testimonial" class="section max-container left-align">
          Through our analysis of the Seoul Bike sharing dataset alongside weather factors, we've uncovered several significant
          insights that shed light on the dynamics of bike sharing in Seoul and its relationship with weather conditions.<br>

        
          Firstly, we observed a clear correlation between weather patterns and bike rental demand. Days with clear skies and mild
          temperatures tended to see higher bike rental activity, while extreme weather conditions such as heavy rain or strong
          winds correlated with decreased usage. This finding emphasizes the impact of weather on people's willingness and ability
          to engage in outdoor activities like biking.</p><br>

          Furthermore, our analysis revealed seasonal variations in bike sharing usage. During the warmer months, demand for bike
          rentals peaked, aligning with expectations of more favorable weather conditions for outdoor activities. Conversely,
          colder months saw a decline in usage, suggesting a preference for indoor modes of transportation during inclement
          weather.</p><br>

          Moreover, we identified specific weather factors that exerted the most influence on bike rental patterns. Variables such
          as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed emerged as key determinants of rental demand. Understanding the interplay
          between these weather variables and bike sharing activity is crucial for optimizing bike sharing services and resource
          allocation based on weather forecasts.</p><br>


          Importantly, our analysis highlights the potential for leveraging weather data to enhance bike sharing services in
          Seoul. By integrating real-time weather information into bike sharing platforms, operators can anticipate fluctuations
          in demand, optimize bike distribution, and provide users with personalized recommendations based on weather conditions.</p><br>


          Lastly, our findings underscore the importance of considering weather factors in urban transportation planning and
          policy-making. As cities strive to promote sustainable and active modes of transportation like biking, understanding the
          influence of weather on bike sharing usage is essential for designing resilient and user-centric transportation systems.</p><br>


          In conclusion, our analysis demonstrates the significant impact of weather on bike sharing activity in Seoul. By
          leveraging data insights, stakeholders can make informed decisions to enhance the accessibility, efficiency, and
          sustainability of bike sharing services, ultimately contributing to a more vibrant and resilient urban environment.</p><br>
