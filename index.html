            The latest United Nations report, as of 2018, reveals that over half of the global population resided in urban areas, a
            figure projected to soar to 68% by 2050. With urbanization on the rise, cities are confronting fresh challenges that
            demand innovative solutions across housing, infrastructure, services, and transportation. Adapting to evolving mobility
            needs mandates cost-effective, eco-friendly, and reliable transport methods to facilitate seamless movement of people
            and goods, thereby addressing issues like traffic congestion, air pollution, and lengthy commutes.

            Seoul Bicycle Sharing is a public bike-sharing initiative available in Seoul, South Korea, engineered to offer
            convenient and eco-friendly transportation options for residents and visitors alike. The performance of Seoul Bicycle
            Sharing has been consistently improving year by year. The average daily use surged to 87,817, marking a six-fold
            increase from 2017 (13,783 cases). The rental cases from January to May 2022 totaled 14.14 million, indicating a 38.3%
            increase compared to the same period last year.

          <h2 class="title">Topic explanation</h2>
          <p class="home__description">   
            Despite its growing popularity, concerns over the mounting deficit have surfaced. The deficit, which stood at 9 billion
            won in 2019, increased to 9.9 billion won in 2020 and 10.3 billion won last year. The annual deficit of Seoul Bicycle
            Sharing has been steadily rising since 2016, reaching 2.5 billion won. Behind the project's acclaim, such as the Seoul
            Metropolitan Government's announcement to inject 3,000 more bicycles this year, the chronic deficit remains unresolved.

            Machine learning technology can play a pivotal role in optimizing operations, enhancing user experience, and ensuring
            the long-term sustainability of Seoul Bicycle Sharing and similar bike-sharing programs. Firstly, by analyzing
            historical usage data, machine learning algorithms can forecast bicycle demand at different times and locations across
            the city, facilitating optimal bike distribution to meet demand. Secondly, machine learning algorithms can adjust
            pricing dynamically based on factors like time of day, weather conditions, and special events, encouraging usage during
            off-peak hours and less congested areas. This strategy helps balance demand across the system. Lastly, machine learning
            algorithms can analyze sensor data from bicycles to predict potential mechanical failures or maintenance needs
            preemptively, minimizing downtime and enhancing overall user satisfaction.

            Answers to the following 12 questions will be obtained through dataset analysis and based on the results, it will help
            create a more economical and sustainable Seoul shared bicycle business.<br>

          The 'Seoul Bicycle Sharing' dataset was initially intended to be sourced from https://data.seoul.go.kr/. However, due to
          the Lunar New Year holiday season in East Asia, the servers hosting the bike dataset were temporarily suspended.
          Consequently, an alternative dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/seoul-bike-sharing/data was
          utilized. This dataset includes various fields such as 'date', 'temperature_2m', 'relative_humidity_2m', 'dew_point_2m',

            The Linear Regression Model Section for your dataset involves applying a statistical technique to analyze the
            relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable. In this context, the linear

            dependent variable, such as bike usage. The process typically includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation,
            and interpretation of the model coefficients to understand the impact of each independent variable on the dependent

            throughout the year is crucial for business management. In Seoul, the period between December and February, the coldest
            months, sees the fewest bicycle rentals. Following this, during August, the hottest month in Seoul, rental numbers are
            also low. From this graph, it can be inferred that temperature significantly influences bicycle rental volume.

            In a linear regression model, variables like temperature and humidity can be used as independent variables that are
            related to the dependent variable (bike rental counts). These variables are associated with weather conditions and can
            potentially influence bike rental demand. using such weather variables as independent variables in the model can help predict bike rental counts. However,
            depending on the dataset, other independent variables may also be useful, and selecting the appropriate variables based
            on the analysis goals and domain is crucial.

      <section id="testimonial" class="section max-container left-align">
          Through our analysis of the Seoul Bike sharing dataset alongside weather factors, we've uncovered several significant
          insights that shed light on the dynamics of bike sharing in Seoul and its relationship with weather conditions.<br>

        
          Firstly, we observed a clear correlation between weather patterns and bike rental demand. Days with clear skies and mild
          temperatures tended to see higher bike rental activity, while extreme weather conditions such as heavy rain or strong
          winds correlated with decreased usage. This finding emphasizes the impact of weather on people's willingness and ability
          to engage in outdoor activities like biking.</p><br>

          Furthermore, our analysis revealed seasonal variations in bike sharing usage. During the warmer months, demand for bike
          rentals peaked, aligning with expectations of more favorable weather conditions for outdoor activities. Conversely,
          colder months saw a decline in usage, suggesting a preference for indoor modes of transportation during inclement
          weather.</p><br>

          Moreover, we identified specific weather factors that exerted the most influence on bike rental patterns. Variables such
          as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed emerged as key determinants of rental demand. Understanding the interplay
          between these weather variables and bike sharing activity is crucial for optimizing bike sharing services and resource
          allocation based on weather forecasts.</p><br>


          Importantly, our analysis highlights the potential for leveraging weather data to enhance bike sharing services in
          Seoul. By integrating real-time weather information into bike sharing platforms, operators can anticipate fluctuations
          in demand, optimize bike distribution, and provide users with personalized recommendations based on weather conditions.</p><br>


          Lastly, our findings underscore the importance of considering weather factors in urban transportation planning and
          policy-making. As cities strive to promote sustainable and active modes of transportation like biking, understanding the
          influence of weather on bike sharing usage is essential for designing resilient and user-centric transportation systems.</p><br>


          In conclusion, our analysis demonstrates the significant impact of weather on bike sharing activity in Seoul. By
          leveraging data insights, stakeholders can make informed decisions to enhance the accessibility, efficiency, and
          sustainability of bike sharing services, ultimately contributing to a more vibrant and resilient urban environment.</p><br>
